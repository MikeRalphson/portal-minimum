# API Evangelist Portal (Minimum Viable)

# This is mean to be a simple example of a portal for any API.
# It provides a forkable portal, with checklist any API provider can follow.
# It uses Jekyl, and can be controlled mostly via this _config.yml page.

# Portal
# Every API should have a simple portal providing access to the API and all supporting resources.

# Name - Provide a simple name for your API / developer portal.
portal_name: 'Minimum Viable API Portal'

# URL - developer.[yourdomain].com
portal_url: http://portal.minimum.apievangelist.com

# Description - Provide a concise description of what a platform does.
portal_description: This is a forkable, resusable API portal that runs using Jekyll. It is meant to be a single checklist that API providers can use to setup a developer portal, and make sure they are providing the minimum amount of documentation, and other resources that developers are used to.

#Getting Started - This section gives developers all the informaiton they will need to get started using an API.
getting_started:
  # A title for the getting started section
  title: Getting Started With The API
  # A description for the getting started section.
  description: Getting started should cover everything developers will need to get up and running with an API. After finishing your API, and you think it is ready for prime time, grab someone who knows nothing about the API, and watch them try to use it. Use what you learn to craft a simple opening paragraph, then some steps users can follow.<br /><br />Here are some some sample steps to get started.

  footer: You should close up your getting started steps with some other helpful information. Depending on the other building blocks you offer as part of API operations, you can provide links to other existing resources.<br /><br />Make sure and let your users know that you are there if they need help, and to contact you with questions, or if there is anything that can done to make it easier--always be improving on the getting started process.

# Authentication - Help developers understand authentication. There are a handful of common approaches from BasicAuth, and API keys, to oAuth--provide a simple overview of how authentication is handled.
authentication:

  # The overal authentication title & description
  title: Authentication
  description: This the authentication page for this template API portal. It should provide as much detail as possible about how to authenticate with an API. Try to keep things as concise as possible, and explain it like you are explaining to someone who knows nothing about your API. Make sure and try to use common approaches to API authentication.

  # The title & description if API is open.
  open_title: Open API (Publicly Available)
  open_description: We do not use authentication, with all API paths left open to the public.
  open_url: http://example.com/open/

  # The title & description if API is open.
  basic_title: Basic Authentication
  basic_description: We employ Basic Authentication for making calls to the API, requring user and password sent as headers.
  basic_url: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication

  # The title & description if API is open.
  keys_title: API Keys
  keys_description: We employ a public keys and secret key for making calls to the API, sent as headers.
  keys_url: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface_key

  # The title & description if API is open.
  oauth_title: OAuth
  oauth_description: We use OAuth to secure the API, and manage access to information.
  oauth_url: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth

  # The title & description if API is open.
  json_web_token_title: JSON Web Tokens
  json_web_token_description: We use JSON Web Tokens to secure the API, and manage access to information.
  json_web_token_url: https://jwt.io/

  # The title & description if API is open.
  other_title: Custom Authentication
  other_description: We use a custom or proprietary approach to authentication for all API calls.
  other_url: http://example.com/auth/

  # The footer for the content and page.
  footer: Consider also providing an authentication tester, and if oAuth is used, it can be helpful to allow develoeprs to manually generate access tokens, to simply making test API calls. Remember authentication is one of the biggest areas struggle with when onboarding, so keep it as simple as possible.
